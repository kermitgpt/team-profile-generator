## Description

In this project I created a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

## Installation

Once you have cloned the repo run "node index.js" to begin the series of prompts. The first prompt will be for the manager role, and after that you can create as many Engineers and Interns as you would like.

## Usage

Create as many people as you would like on your new team by following the prompts given. When you are finished creating your last team member simply select the option "Finish building team" and your new website will be created. Look in the "dist" folder for your new webpage which will be saved as "index.html".
